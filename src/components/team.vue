            Engr. Duniya has had a chequered working experience of over

            Finishing) with GEMS1 Support to the Meat and Leather Industry
            Project funded by DFID which had such impressive results such that
            when GEMS1 ended, he was absorbed by another DFID funded project -

            In the 1000s+ IFDC Regional Project financed by USAID, Engr.
            Duniya's pioneering work as the first Cluster Adviser and country
            lead of the project, led to the establishment of 26 Clusters of
            commodity value chains in five States of Nigeria using the
            Competitive Agricultural Systems and Enterprises (CASE) approach. He
            helped to link up the various actors at different levels leading to
            round table workshops and planning workshops where they collectively
            strategized on how they could collectively grow their businesses.
            The actors were challenged/assisted to identify and rank their
            peculiar problems and facilitators identified to address these
            limitations through workshops, demonstrations and/or field trips.
            These interventions led to increases in production, use of modern
            agricultural practices/marketing and general well-being of the
            target groups. Facilitated the links with other intervention agents
            in the field leading to synergistic collaborat ions through MOUs and
            gent leman' s understandings/collaborations.
